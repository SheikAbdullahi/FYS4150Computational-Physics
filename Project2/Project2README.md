# README.md for Project 2 Repository

## Compilation, Linking, and Running the Code

Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed, especially to handle matrix operations.

1. **Compile:** Use the g++ compiler (or any C++ compiler you have). For instance, to compile `Project2Problem2.cpp`, run:
   ```
   g++ Project2Problem2.cpp -o output -larmadillo
   ```
   This will generate an executable named `output`.

2. **Run:** Once compiled, you can execute the binary:
   ```
   ./output
   ```

## Repository File Descriptions


1. **Document Setup**: The document uses the `article` class and imports various packages, including those necessary for graphics, math notations, code listings, and links. The title, author, and date are set up for the document.

2. **Title & GitHub Link**: The document begins with a title, your name, the date, and a link to the full implementation of your project on GitHub.

3. **Introduction**: This section introduces the mathematical problem that needs to be solved. Specifically, it starts with the equation named `bb_eq_1` and shows the goal to express it as `bb_eq_2` using certain transformations.

4. **Problem 1**: This section provides a step-by-step transformation of `bb_eq_1` to `bb_eq_2` by changing variables and performing mathematical manipulations.

5. **Problem 2**: A summary of the program's ability to set up a tridiagonal matrix and solve the eigenvalue problem. The solution can be found in the given GitHub link.

6. **Problem 3**: Describes the creation and testing of a C++ function that identifies the largest off-diagonal element in a matrix. There's also a GitHub link for detailed implementation.

7. **Problem 4**: Details the successful implementation of Jacobi's rotation algorithm in C++ and testing it for a \(6 \times 6\) matrix.

8. **Problem 5**: Discusses the scaling of sparse matrices and provides a discussion and conclusion based on the observations made during the project.

9. **Problem 6**: Provides a brief description of the Python code used to compare analytical and numerical eigenvectors. Visualizations (figures) are included in this section to provide a clearer understanding of the comparison, and they are structured using minipages to sit side-by-side.


## Project Description

This project, part of FYS3150/FYS4150 â€“ Computational Physics at the University of Oslo, aims to solve a series of problems related to matrices, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors.

The main objective is to find solutions to a given problem statement, starting with an equation named `bb_eq_1` and showing that it can be transformed to another equation named `bb_eq_2` using mathematical substitutions. The project then moves on to deal with matrix operations, eigenvalue problems, and comparisons between analytical and numerical solutions.

The complete project involves the derivation of formulas, writing and testing C++ code, and visualizing results using Python.

For more detailed information, refer to the LaTeX document provided in the repository.
