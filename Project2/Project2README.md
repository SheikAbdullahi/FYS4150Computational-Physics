## Project Essence

Commencing with the initial equation `bb_eq_1`, the project endeavors to demonstrate its transformation to `bb_eq_2` through methodical mathematical substitutions. As the project progresses, it delves deeper into matrix manipulations, eigenvalue problems, and the contrast between analytical and numerical solutions, intertwining theory with practice.

The cohesive synergy between mathematical derivations, C++ coding, and Python-based visualizations establishes the robust foundation of this project.
